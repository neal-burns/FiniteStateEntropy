int FSE_compress(char* dest, const char* source, int inputSize) does the following:
1. count symbol occurence from table source[] into table count[]
2. normalize counters so that sum(counting[]) == Power_of_2 (== 2^tableLog)
3. saves normalized counters to memory buffer using writeHeader()
4. builds encoding tables from the normalized counters
5. encodes the data stream using encoding tables

int FSE_decompress(char* dest, int originalSize, const char* compressed) performs:
1. reads normalized counters with readHeader()
2. builds decoding tables from the normalized counters
3. decodes the data stream using these decoding tables

/*
The first step is to count all symbols. FSE_count() provides one quick way to do this job.
Result will be saved into 'count', a table of unsigned int, which must be already allocated, and have 'maxNbSymbols' cells.
'source' is assumed to be a table of char of size 'sourceSize' if 'maxNbSymbols' <= 256.
All values within 'source' MUST be < maxNbSymbols.
FSE_count() will return the highest symbol value detected into 'source' (necessarily <= 'maxNbSymbols', can be 0 if only 0 is present).
If there is an error, the function will return -1.

The next step is to normalize the frequencies, so that Sum_of_Frequencies == 2^tableLog.
You can use 'tableLog'==0 to mean "default value".
The result will be saved into a structure, called 'normalizedCounter', which is a table of unsigned int.
'normalizedCounter' must be already allocated, and have 'nbSymbols' cells.
FSE_normalizeCount() will ensure that sum of 'nbSymbols' frequencies is == 2 ^'tableLog', it also guarantees a minimum of 1 to any Symbol which frequency is >= 1.
FSE_normalizeCount() can work "in place" to preserve memory, using 'count' as both source and destination area.
The return value is the adjusted tableLog. It is necessary to retrieve it for next steps.
A result of '0' means that there is only a single symbol present.
If there is an error, the function will return -1.

'normalizedCounter' can be saved in a compact manner to a memory area using FSE_writeHeader().
The target memory area must be pointed by 'header'.
'header' buffer must be already allocated. Its size must be at least FSE_headerBound().
The result of the function is the number of bytes written into 'header'.
If there is an error, the function will return -1.

'normalizedCounter' can then be used to create the compression tables 'CTable'.
The space required by 'CTable' must be already allocated. Its size is provided by FSE_sizeof_CTable().
You can then use FSE_buildCTable() to fill 'CTable'.
In both cases, if there is an error, the function will return -1.

'CTable' can then be used to compress 'source', with FSE_compress_usingCTable().
Similar to FSE_count(), the convention is that 'source' is assumed to be a table of char of size 'sourceSize'
The function returns the size of compressed data (without header), or -1 if failed.

The first step is to get the normalized frequency of symbols.
This can be performed by reading a header with FSE_readHeader().
'normalizedCounter' must be already allocated, and have at least 'nbSymbols' cells.
In practice, that means it's necessary to know 'nbSymbols' beforehand,
or size it to handle worst case situations (typically 256).
FSE_readHeader will provide 'tableLog' and 'nbSymbols' stored into the header.
The result of FSE_readHeader() is the number of bytes read from 'header'.
The following values have special meaning :
return 2 : there is only a single symbol value. The value is provided into the second byte.
return 1 : data is uncompressed
If there is an error, the function will return -1.

The next step is to create the decompression tables 'DTable' from 'normalizedCounter'.
This is performed by the function FSE_buildDTable().
The space required by 'DTable' must be already allocated. Its size is provided by FSE_sizeof_DTable().

'DTable' can then be used to decompress 'compressed', with FSE_decompress_usingDTable().
FSE_decompress_usingDTable() will regenerate exactly 'originalSize' symbols, as a table of unsigned char.
The function returns the size of compressed data (without header), or -1 if failed.

/*
We are now inside the core function FSE_compress_usingCTable().
The primary purpose of exposing its inner components is to allow the mixing of FSE coding
with other source bit data, including multiple FSE encoders in parallel.

A key property to keep in mind is that encoding and decoding are done **in reverse direction**.
So the first symbol you will encode is the last you will decode.
The same logic applies to any other bitstream value you want to insert into the bitstream.

You will need a few variables to track your bitStream. They are :

void* op;           // Your output buffer (must be already allocated)
void* compressionStreamDescriptor;   // Required to init and close the bitStream
void* CTable;       // Provided by FSE_buildCTable()
ptrdiff_t state;    // Store fractional bits
size_t bitStream=0; // Cache bitStream into register before writing it
int bitpos=0;       // Nb of bits already used within bitStream
void* symbolTT;     // Encoding Table n°1. Provided by init. Required by encodeByte.
void* stateTable;   // Encoding Table n°2. Provided by init. Required by encodeByte.


The first thing to do is to init the bitStream.
    void* compressionStreamDescriptor = FSE_initCompressionStream(&op, &state, &symbolTT, &stateTable, CTable);

You can then encode your input data, byte after byte.
You are free to choose the direction in which you encode, as long as you remember decoding will be done in reverse direction.
    FSE_encodeByte(&state, &bitStream, &bitpos, (unsigned char*)symbol, symbolTT, stateTable);

At any time, you can add any other bit sequence.
Note : maximum allowed nbBits is 25
    FSE_addBits(&bitStream, &bitpos, nbBits, bitField);

Writing data to memory is performed by the flush method.
This way, you can store several bitFields into bitStream, before calling flush a single time.
BitStream size is 64-bits on 64-bits systems, 32-bits on 32-bits systems (size_t).
The nb of bits already written into bitStream is stored into bitPos.
For information, FSE_encodeByte() never writes more than 'tableLog' bits at a time.
    FSE_flushBits(&bitStream, &op, &bitpos);

When you are done with compression, you must close the bitStream.
The function returns the size in bytes of the compressed stream.
If there is an error, it returns -1.
    int size = FSE_closeCompressionStream(bitStream, bitPos, state, op, compressionStreamDescriptor, CTable);

int FSE_closeDecompressionStream(const void* decompressionStreamDescriptor, const void* input);

/*
Now is the turn to decompose FSE_decompress_usingDTable().
You will decode FSE_encoded symbols from the bitStream,
but also any other bitFields you put in, **in reverse order**.
So, typically, if you encoded from end to beginning, you will now decode from beginning to end.

You will need a few variables to track your bitStream. They are :

const void* input;        // Your input buffer (where compressed data is)
const void* decompressionStreamDescriptor;   // Required to init and close the bitStream
const void* DTable;       // Provided by FSE_buildDTable()
int   tableLog;           // Provided by FSE_readHeader()
unsigned int state;       // Store fractional bits.
unsigned int bitStream;   // Cache bitStream into register
int bitsConsumed;         // Nb of bits already used within bitStream

The first thing to do is to init the bitStream.
    decompressionStreamDescriptor = FSE_initDecompressionStream(&ip, &bitsConsumed, &state);

You can then decode your data, byte after byte.
Keep in mind data is decoded in reverse order.
    unsigned char symbol = FSE_decodeSymbol(&state, bitStream, &bitsConsumed, DTable);

You can also retrieve any bitfield you eventually stored into the bitStream (in reverse order)
Note : maximum allowed nbBits is 25
    unsigned int bitField = FSE_readBits(&bitsConsumed, bitStream, nbBits);

Reading data to memory is performed by the update method.
'bitConsumed' shall never > 32.
For information the maximum number of bits read by FSE_decodeSymbol() is 'tableLog'.
Don't hesitate to use this method frequently. The cost of this operation is very low.
    FSE_updateBitStream(&bitStream, &bitsConsumed, &ip);;

When you are done with compression, you can close the bitStream (optional).
The function returns the size in bytes of the compressed stream.
If there is an error, it returns -1.
    int size = FSE_closeDecompressionStream(decompressionStreamDescriptor, ip, bitsConsumed);
